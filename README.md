# UPI-Simulation
A backend-driven simulation of the Unified Payments Interface (UPI) built using SimPy and Flask.

A backend simulation of India's Unified Payments Interface (UPI) using SimPy for event-based process simulation and Flask for RESTful APIs. This project models realistic UPI transaction flows between users, banks, and a central UPI router to test concurrency, transaction handling, and system delays.

🚀 Features
Simulates user-to-user UPI transactions

Models multiple banks with configurable processing times

Event-driven flow using SimPy (discrete-event simulation)

Flask APIs to initiate and track transactions

Logs transaction status, delays, and completion time

🛠️ Tech Stack
Python 3

SimPy – for process-based discrete event simulation

Flask – lightweight web server for APIs
